Description:
In 2010 Google shut down its Chinese search engine after it had been targeted by a cyberattack from within China. Google made the decision to no longer abide by Chinaâ€™s strict censorship rules and directed all of its Chinese traffic to its uncensored search engine in Hong Kong. This led to the eventual shutdown of all Google services within China.
